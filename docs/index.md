All of these combined can let you to easily build powerful web applications. It uses the Material Design RWD Template with UI Components to fully render the user interface that can be controlled from the PHP code level.

Antares is fully modular, meaning that you can easily create your own modules and extend it's possibilites for your own purposes. Additionally, it includes a lot of modules by default that can save you tons of time with the most common functionality of every web-application.

   - [UI Strucure](modules_development/views.md) - Look how easy you can design your own views on every user level.
   
4. Start building your own Modules following **Modules Development** section or try with our tutorial to build [Sample Module](tutorials/sample_module.md).

5. During the development, you will definitely want to use available services in the system that can help you speed up your pace and extend your systems functionality. **It is a key to deliver a stable and consistent solution**.
