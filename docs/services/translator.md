# Translator  

[TOC]

## Configuration  

The platform supports application's multilingualism through language files determined in component's or module's space. Determining the location of a language file usually happens in module's service provider 'boot' method by calling:

```php
$this->addLanguageComponent('antares/foo', 'antares/foo', "{$path}/lang");
```

where the `$path` variable determines the location of language files' catalogue. You have to remember about retaining the correct structure as below:

![AT_TRANS01.PNG](../img/docs/services/translator/AT_TRANS01.PNG)
  
It is also possible to use a global catalogue located in:

```bash
resources/lang
```

or user's per level:

```bash
resources/lang/administrators
```

Remember that such solution will cause that translations will no longer be available in the 'translations' component and may be overwritten by publication.

## Usage  

Referring to the translation contained in the configuration file is possible with the use of:

```html
{{ trans('antares/foo::messages.foo_test') }}
```

where `antares/foo` is the name of the module, `messages` is the name of the file, whereas `foo_test` is the translated phrase. More information about how the translator works can be found [here](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/localization).
